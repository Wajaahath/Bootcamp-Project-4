üñ•Ô∏è How It Works

Data Management
- The program uses SQLite, a lightweight, file-based database, to store all financial data. Tables are created for expenses, income, budgets, and financial goals during the initial setup.
- All data persists across sessions, allowing users to resume where they left off.

User Interaction
- The CLI guides users through a menu-driven interface.
- Users select actions like adding expenses, setting budgets, or viewing summaries from the main menu.
- All inputs are validated to ensure data accuracy (e.g., correct date formats, valid numerical values).

üîß Menu Structure
- Add Expense/Income: Prompts for category, amount, and date, then saves the data.
- View Records: Displays all or filtered data from the database.
- Set Budget: Allows users to assign budget amounts to specific categories.
- Manage Financial Goals: Facilitates goal setting, updating progress, and tracking achievements.
- Summaries: Calculates totals for income and expenses, checks budget adherence, and lists goals achieved.
- Update/Delete: Modify or remove records from any category.
- Exit: Safely exits the program, preserving all data.

üñãÔ∏è Example Workflow
- Start the program and set a budget for the "Groceries" category.
- Add an expense for $50 under "Groceries" with a due date.
- View all expenses to confirm the entry.
- Add income from a salary source and track total earnings.
- Create a financial goal (e.g., Save $10,000 for a vacation).
- Periodically update the saved amount for the vacation goal.
- View the budget summary to check spending against the budget.
- Achieve financial goals and celebrate progress!

üõ†Ô∏è Requirements
